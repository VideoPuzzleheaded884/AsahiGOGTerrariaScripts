# Terraria Asahi

1. Download Terraria from GOG for linux and move it to the root of this directory. Should be a file like `terraria_v1_4_4_9_v4_60321.sh`.

2. Set up the dependencies. I needed `sudo dnf install make cmake gcc mono-devel` for building the dependencies and running.

3. Run setup.sh. It should only take about a minute to download and build the dependencies. I have a pretty fast internet connection though so it might take longer for you.

4. From here you should just be able to run `./run.sh` and it'll work. I haven't had any crashes so far. Let me know if you run into anything.
